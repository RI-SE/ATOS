ATOS, short for AV Test Operating System, is a ISO 22133-compliant and ROS2-based control center and coordinator for scenario-based testing of autonomous vehicles. ATOS controls, monitors and coordinates both physical and virtual vehicles and equipment according to scenarios specified in the ASAM OpenSCENARIOÂ® format. It is made for running in real-time and uses GPS time to ensure exact and repeatable execution between runs.
