## Pull requests


**Please ask in the [discussions](https://github.com/RI-SE/ATOS/discussions) tab** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing new features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project. 

Please adhere to the [coding conventions](https://github.com/RI-SE/ATOS/wiki/Coding-Conventions) used throughout the project (indentation,
accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

Follow this process if you'd like your work considered for inclusion in the
project.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to
license your work under the same license as that used by the project.
