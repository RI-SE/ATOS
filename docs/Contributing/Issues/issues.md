## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/RI-SE/ATOS/issues) on the repo page is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs) and feature requests. If you want to submit a pull request that relates to a specific issue or bug, please select the bug in question and use the "create a branch for this issue or link a pull request" option under the development heading to link your pull request to the issue.

In general, also please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests. [The discussions tab](https://github.com/RI-SE/ATOS/discussions) on the repo can be used for this instead. 

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is an error, flaw or fault in the design of a piece of software or code.
We welcome bug reports, as they are extremely helpful in furthering the development of the project.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub bug search** &mdash; check if the bug has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the bug has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `main` or development branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash;
A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is
your environment? What steps will reproduce the bug? What OS are you using, which
browser is used for the gui?What would you expect to be the outcome? All these
details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

The bug report template is present in the bug tab on gihub, a copy of it can be found [here](https://github.com/RI-SE/ATOS/blob/feature_bug_issue_template/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
