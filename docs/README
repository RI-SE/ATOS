When editing locally, install deps with 
"sudo apt install doxygen && pip install -r requirements.txt"

Then run "mkdocs serve" from the ATOS root folder.

When adding python deps, add these to requirements.in and then run the "pip-compile" from pip-tools https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
